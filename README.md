# tenzies-game

Is a ten dice game where the objective is to flip the dice until all dice have the same value. Based on a [Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) project, it was further enhanced adding Bootstrap responsive design, and displaying a CSS grid that resembles a real dice, instead of the original display of numbers.
